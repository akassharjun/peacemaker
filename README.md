## Background

### FEDERATED LEARNING
Technology that allows machine learning models to be trained on edge devices, preserving data privacy and allowing us to apply machine learning to previously data sensitive usecases.

### DIFFERENT SETTINGS IN FEDERATED LEARNING
Federated Learning provides two different settings in which it can be applied; the cross-device setting & the cross-silo setting. 

#### Cross-Device

The cross-device setting in FL typically revolves around a service provider and its consumers. The clients in this case are usually mobile phones or Internet of Things devices. These clients are responsible for collaboratively training a model for the service provider. The best example of cross-device is Google's Keyboard. refer this [link](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html)

#### Cross-Silo

### EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERATED LEARNING
The effectiveness of a Federated Learning system relies on various aspects, one of which is the most important; client participation.
